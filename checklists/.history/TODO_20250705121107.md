# TODO: Checklist Application Development

## 🏗️ COMPLETED: Centralized Save Architecture
*Foundation implemented and integrated with field manager*

### ✅ Core Save Functions Implemented
- [x] **saveFieldDefinitions()** - Save fields.json (fully implemented with WORKER_URL)
- [x] **Centralized data-persistence.js** - Generic save/load functions for all data types
- [x] **Validation system** - Data validation before saving
- [x] **Error handling** - Consistent error handling across all save operations
- [x] **Progress indicators** - User feedback during save operations
- [x] **State synchronization** - Automatic state updates after saves

### ✅ Field Manager Integration
- [x] **Updated data-fields.js** - Uses centralized save/load functions
- [x] **Field creation persistence** - New fields are actually saved to fields.json
- [x] **UI refresh mechanism** - Fields dialog updates after creating new fields
- [x] **Event system** - dataUpdated events trigger UI refreshes

### Remaining Save Functions to Migrate
- [ ] **saveChecklist()** - Save checklist data
- [ ] **saveNote()** - Save notes
- [ ] **saveUsers()** - Save user management data (partially done)
- [ ] **saveConfig()** - Save configuration data
- [ ] **saveLayouts()** - Save layout definitions
- [ ] **saveFilters()** - Save filter definitions

## 🔧 Field Manager - Status Update
*Major issues resolved, minor polish remaining*

### ✅ Issues Fixed
- [x] **Field persistence**: New fields are now saved to fields.json via centralized save
- [x] **State synchronization**: fieldDefs and sharedState.fieldsData stay in sync
- [x] **UI refresh**: Fields chooser dialog updates after field creation
- [x] **Active/Visible functionality**: Fields appear in checklist because they exist in fields.json

### Remaining Minor Issues
- [ ] **Dialog scrollability**: Verify source/options fields are visible and scrollable
- [ ] **UI polish**: Final testing of field creation workflow

---

## 🎯 Layout Manager (After Centralized Save)
- [ ] **Create Layout Manager Dialog**: UI for creating/editing layouts
- [ ] **Access Level Controls**: Layout-level access restrictions
- [ ] **Layout Preview**: Show how layout will look for different users
- [ ] **Layout Assignment**: Assign layouts to users/roles

---

## 🔍 Filter Manager (After Layout Manager)
- [ ] **Create Filter Manager Dialog**: UI for advanced filter creation
- [ ] **Filter Logic Builder**: Visual filter condition builder
- [ ] **Filter Access Controls**: User-level filter restrictions
- [ ] **Filter Testing**: Preview filter results

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Field Manager Testing**: Complete testing of field creation flow
- [ ] **Layout Manager Testing**: Test layout assignment and access controls
- [ ] **Filter Manager Testing**: Test filter creation and application
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test all components working together
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure dialogs work on mobile devices
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Visual Polish**: Consistent styling across all dialogs
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Better loading states and error messages

---

## 📚 Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all save functions and their parameters
- [ ] **User Guide Updates**: Update user guide with new features
- [ ] **Development Guide**: Guide for future developers
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: Guide for migrating from old save functions

---

## 🔄 Current Status
**NEXT STEP**: Implement centralized save architecture starting with `data-persistence.js`

This will resolve the field manager issues and provide the foundation for all future features.
