If the CHP would not be enough, a heat pump could replace this </li><li>When second and third lines installed: choice of Cosucra to be determined: CHP or Heat Pump. So they can adapt their decision based on the energy prices.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Client has a particular way of working: </p><ol><li>120 days per year on a 24/7 regime</li><li>After that : the workers are present, but the equipment does not run</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Therefore: the B machines would need more maintenance, and the people are there. (magnetrons etc)</li></ol><p>Current phase: </p><ol><li>in order to have 1 line operational 08/2027</li><li>We need everything ready early before that date (building, training etc)</li><li>the above will be only possible with a good pre-engineering: </li><li class="ql-indent-1">Kametal makes one part </li><li class="ql-indent-1">Eleantis starts cbling, Kametal starts next module</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Eleantis sends us the first module</li><li class="ql-indent-1">We need to install all the microwave components, and test them</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Then the module goes to Kametal Genk or to Cosucra (in order to stack them)</li><li class="ql-indent-2">The total height would be around 12 m, nut we could change to a longer not so high machine</li><li class="ql-indent-2">anticipation: project execution : october 2025</li><li class="ql-indent-1"> back to a.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Now the client needs to sign their P.O.: Carlo is busy with that.</p><p><br></p><p>The total PreEngineering: 310 000€: they want to pay this in order to finalise our total project price (2030 version), knowing it will be split to be decided knowing 2027 = 1 line (total = 3 lines)</p><p>313 039.54 €= a bit above their sigining ability, they proposed to prepay 10% and then in slices afterwards (now until end july)</p><p><br></p><p>commercially: the client <strong>knows </strong>that we want this, that this is a very big project for us, and they know that there is a certain financial risk , this is followed up by Carlo with his network (Banks, Cordeel, etc) </p><p><br></p><p>now we need to start Pre-Engineering, The P&amp;ID is the result of the Pre-Engineering</p><p><br></p><p>There were a lot of trials with Thomas, we need to look at the process. </p><p><br></p><p>Their current installation uses the spare heat from other processes, they are not so happy, because sometimes they stick together.</p><p>This means we need to do some more in house tests, however we don't need to reinvent the wheel</p><p>We already know how to transport and mw treat the product. </p><p><br></p><p>It is a very potent project for Meam, and it is because of all the work since 2023...</p><p><br></p><p>We know extremely well what we do , but we never worked such a big project. Frédéric will be the project leader. the final team </p><p><br></p><p>Reporting is very important:</p><ol><li>The minutes of the meetings</li><li>The hours of working on the project need to be reported in Odoo.</li><li>Not imposed : weekly meeting. </li><li>So if there is the need for a meeting use the RASCI, if we are late, we need to know that the work of our colleagues will be jeopardized. </li><li>When decision are needed to be made: keep it dry, but communicate with supervisor (Accountable or Support)</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Jeamichel : thehy have a problem currently with electrical power: how much is the final power? Cuong: it is &gt; 3MW</p><p>Detail: high power cabinet close to our machine</p><p><br></p><p>Frédéric showed the Presentation which is attached at the <strong>scope </strong>in this list. (go to Scope)</p><p><br></p><p>Extra: the client has manhours during downtime: so they want to do some things themselves.  E.G. we would only have 1 or 2 persons to install the machine, and we can provide the client a list of needed persons or equipment, to have a co-operation, diminishing the installation costs. </p><p><br></p><p>Thomas: They had a bio-project on the side, is still ongoing. Frédéric: their management thinks "electricity" supposing the CO2 is zero (not true of course), that is why we neede to make a 'story' that could be 'sold' to their managment. First thing was to change their perception, also the amount or biogass they have is limited, and it is becoming marginal. </p><p><br></p><p>The drying of pulp is more profitable than throwing it away, which cost, in the turn the drying of pulp is double return. </p><p><br></p><p>Thomas: different products? How about that, handling is important and maybe some more tests will be needed</p><p><br></p><p>Frederic: we also know that the chicory evolves and it is needed that somebody goes overthere to get samples during the ongoing campaign (beginning, middle, end) </p><p>We know that the conditions will change in terms of temp, humidity, etcetera. (Vincent)</p><p><br></p><p>Frédéric: Pre-treatment = preheating and pre-drying (at this moment) , thes are the best hygienic way, maybe we need in between 'hyginiesation'. (Pre-engineering) </p><p>johan: the distribution of the product on the belt is important, and to be carefully pre-egineered</p><p><br></p><p>fréderic: jeamichel: what influences will our line have on their network? It needs to be investigated and a preliminary report needs to be assesed during the pre-engineering. </p><p>Fréderic : cuong: the price of one magnetron (we anticipated 48 magnetrons air cooled) B machine = 3*48 magnetrons. Today 1 magnetron = 500 to 600 euro for a 3 kw , a 2 kW around 450 and a 1 kw &lt; 100: So the question to the client: do you want cheap and a lot changes or more expensive. 1.5 kW ex works China = 50 USD (most cheap) B machine will be 1 to 1.5 kW (1 kW Chine = 15 USD!!! Samsung!) but of course we then talk installing 96, launcher ar 7 euro, fan 10 euro etc.</p><p><br></p><p>Cuong: Javad and Jules will need to simulate more for the B machine.</p><p><br></p><p>frédéric: One connection with the customer = Frédéric. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p style="font-size:0.8em; color:#888;">edited by Johan on 2025_06_24_@_12-07-50</p></body></html>
