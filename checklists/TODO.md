# TODO: Checklist Application Development

## üèóÔ∏è COMPLETED: Centralized Save Architecture & Sources Migration
*Foundation implemented, integrated with field manager, and sources migration complete*

### ‚úÖ Core Save Functions Implemented
- [x] **saveFieldDefinitions()** - Save fields.json (fully implemented with WORKER_URL)
- [x] **Centralized data-persistence.js** - Generic save/load functions for all data types
- [x] **Validation system** - Data validation before saving
- [x] **Error handling** - Consistent error handling across all save operations
- [x] **Progress indicators** - User feedback during save operations
- [x] **State synchronization** - Automatic state updates after saves

### ‚úÖ Sources Migration Completed
- [x] **collaborators migration** - All references updated to use sources.collaborators
- [x] **unitChoices migration** - All references updated to use sources.unitChoices
- [x] **Migration logic** - Automatically migrates legacy structures and removes old properties
- [x] **New checklist creation** - Creates only modern sources structure
- [x] **Backward compatibility** - Seamless migration for existing checklists

### ‚úÖ Field Manager Integration
- [x] **Updated data-fields.js** - Uses centralized save/load functions
- [x] **Field creation persistence** - New fields are actually saved to fields.json
- [x] **UI refresh mechanism** - Fields dialog updates after creating new fields
- [x] **Event system** - dataUpdated events trigger UI refreshes
- [x] **Sources integration** - Field options/sources use new sources structure

### ‚úÖ Layout System Refactor Completed
- [x] **Eliminated legacy "lastused" layout objects** - Removed all nested layout object methodology
- [x] **Implemented "lastlayout" property** - Simple string reference to active layout by name
- [x] **Cleaned up JSON structure** - Removed all nested layouts arrays and duplicated objects
- [x] **Updated layout application logic** - All code now references layouts by name
- [x] **Updated UI components** - Layout selectors and menus use new naming system
- [x] **Migrated existing checklists** - All JSON files cleaned and converted to new structure
- [x] **Updated new checklist creation** - Sets "lastlayout" to "Default" for new checklists

### Remaining Save Functions to Migrate
- [ ] **saveChecklist()** - Save checklist data
- [ ] **saveNote()** - Save notes
- [ ] **saveUsers()** - Save user management data (partially done)
- [ ] **saveConfig()** - Save configuration data
- [ ] **saveLayouts()** - Save layout definitions
- [ ] **saveFilters()** - Save filter definitions

## üîß Field Manager - Status Update
*Major issues resolved, minor polish remaining*

### ‚úÖ Issues Fixed
- [x] **Field persistence**: New fields are now saved to fields.json via centralized save
- [x] **State synchronization**: fieldDefs and sharedState.fieldsData stay in sync
- [x] **UI refresh**: Fields chooser dialog updates after field creation
- [x] **Active/Visible functionality**: Fields appear in checklist because they exist in fields.json
- [x] **Backup system removed**: Eliminated redundant backup functionality (Git provides version control)

### Remaining Minor Issues
- [ ] **Dynamic sources loading**: Update field dialog to show all available sources (collaborators, unitChoices, demo, etc.)
- [ ] **UI polish**: Final testing of field creation workflow

---

## üîÑ In-Memory Undo System (Ctrl-Z)
*Implement undo/redo functionality for checklistData modifications*

### Requirements
- [ ] **Memory-based undo stack**: Keep last 10 checklistData states in memory (not file-based)
- [ ] **Deep clone states**: Store complete deep copies of checklistData before user modifications
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**: Implement Ctrl-Z (undo) and Ctrl-Y (redo) event handlers
- [ ] **State triggers**: Capture state before user actions like:
  - Field value changes
  - Adding/removing checklist items
  - Changing field visibility/order
  - User modifications (not automatic saves)
- [ ] **UI feedback**: Show undo/redo availability in UI (grayed out when unavailable)
- [ ] **Memory management**: Limit to 10 states max, remove oldest when exceeded
- [ ] **State restoration**: Restore complete checklistData and refresh UI components

### Implementation Notes
- Use `structuredClone()` or `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for deep copying
- Hook into existing user interaction events
- Clear undo stack on checklist load/switch
- Separate from file save/load operations

---

## üîÑ In-Memory Undo System (Ctrl-Z)
*Implement user-friendly undo functionality for checklist modifications*

### Features to Implement
- [ ] **Undo Stack**: Keep last 10 checklistData states in memory (circular buffer)
- [ ] **State Capture**: Save checklistData snapshot on user interventions (field changes, user actions, etc.)
- [ ] **Ctrl-Z Handler**: Keyboard shortcut to revert to previous checklistData state
- [ ] **Ctrl-Y Handler**: Redo functionality (forward through undo stack)
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Show undo/redo status in UI (e.g., "Undo: Field value changed")
- [ ] **Smart Capture**: Only capture states on meaningful changes (not every keystroke)
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Efficient circular buffer to prevent memory leaks

### Implementation Notes
- Store complete checklistData snapshots in memory array
- Trigger state capture on: field value changes, user assignments, note additions, etc.
- Use deep cloning to prevent reference issues
- Clear undo stack when loading new checklist

## üéØ Layout Manager (After Centralized Save)
*Create advanced layout management UI - foundational layout system completed*

### Core Layout System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Eliminated legacy "lastused" objects** - Removed all nested layout methodology
- [x] **Implemented "lastlayout" property** - Simple string reference to active layout by name
- [x] **JSON structure cleanup** - Flat layouts array with named layouts only
- [x] **Layout application by name** - All code uses layout names, not objects
- [x] **UI integration** - Layout selectors highlight active layout by name

### Advanced Layout Features (TODO)
- [ ] **Create Layout Manager Dialog**: UI for creating/editing layouts
- [ ] **Access Level Controls**: Layout-level access restrictions
- [ ] **Layout Preview**: Show how layout will look for different users
- [ ] **Layout Assignment**: Assign layouts to users/roles
- [ ] **Layout Validation**: Ensure layouts are valid before saving
- [ ] **Layout Templates**: Common layout templates for quick setup

---

## üîç Filter Manager (After Layout Manager)
- [ ] **Create Filter Manager Dialog**: UI for advanced filter creation
- [ ] **Filter Logic Builder**: Visual filter condition builder
- [ ] **Filter Access Controls**: User-level filter restrictions
- [ ] **Filter Testing**: Preview filter results

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Field Manager Testing**: Complete testing of field creation flow
- [ ] **Layout Manager Testing**: Test layout assignment and access controls
- [ ] **Filter Manager Testing**: Test filter creation and application
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test all components working together
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure dialogs work on mobile devices
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Visual Polish**: Consistent styling across all dialogs
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Better loading states and error messages

---

## üìö Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all save functions and their parameters
- [ ] **User Guide Updates**: Update user guide with new features
- [ ] **Development Guide**: Guide for future developers
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: Guide for migrating from old save functions

---

## üîÑ Current Status
**NEXT STEP**: Continue with in-memory undo system implementation

### Recently Completed
- ‚úÖ **Layout System Refactor**: Eliminated legacy "lastused" objects, implemented clean "lastlayout" property system
- ‚úÖ **JSON Structure Cleanup**: All checklist JSON files now use flat layouts array with named layouts
- ‚úÖ **Code Migration**: Updated all layout-related code to use names instead of objects
- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Layout selectors and menus now highlight active layout by name

### Current Priority
1. **In-Memory Undo System**: Implement Ctrl-Z functionality for user modifications
2. **Complete Save Function Migration**: Migrate remaining save functions to centralized architecture
3. **Advanced Layout Manager**: Build UI for creating/editing layouts with access controls

This provides a solid foundation for all future features with clean data structures and consistent code patterns.
